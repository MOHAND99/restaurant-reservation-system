# Restaurant Reservation System

## Students

1. Mohannd Mohammed
2. Youssef Victor - 6668

## Our workflow

We depended heavily on version control while working together. We followed the following whenever anyone wants to add any code:

1. Create his own branch locally.
2. Make the required code additions or changes.
3. Push the branch remotely and create a merge request.
4. Never merge it, wait the other side to review it.
5. Discuss the requested changes, if any.
6. Merge to master.

Our working experience very smooth as in most cases no one will have to wait until the other side finishes a piece of code.
